                        Natural language processing is used to parse information from a resume, locate keywords, cluster
                        them into
                        sectors depending on their keywords, and finally provide the most relevant information to the
                        user based on
                        keyword matching. The user must first upload a resume to the web site. The resume parser
                        extracts all of the
                        relevant information. After the user confirms, the web app displays the data that the algorithm
                        has retrieved.

                    <p>
                        Every day, corporate firms and recruitment agencies go
                        through a large number of resumes. This is not a human task.
                        There is a need for an automated intelligent system that can
                        extract all of the critical information from unstructured
                        resumes and convert them all to a similar structured format
                        that can then be ranked for a specific employment post. Name,
                        email address, social profiles, personal websites, keywords,
                        and the resume cluster are all parsed information (ex:
                        computer science, human resource, etc.). The parsed data is
                        subsequently saved in a database (in this case, NoSQL) for
                        future use. Resumes are more structured than other
                        unstructured material (email body, web page contents, etc.).
                        Information is organised into different groups.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Each set comprises information on the person's contact
                        information, employment experience, and educational
                        background. Despite this, resumes might be difficult to
                        decipher. This is due to the fact that the sorts of
                        information, the sequence in which they are presented,
                        and the literary style in which they are written differ.
                        They can also be written in a variety of formats. '.txt',
                        '.pdf', '.doc', '.docx', '.odt', '.rtf', and so on are some of the
                        most frequent. The model cannot rely on the order or kind of data to effectively and efficiently
                        extract data
                        from various types of resumes.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">History of hiring</h2>
                    <p>
                        Throughout the years, the hiring procedure has
                        changed. Companies would promote job
                        openings in newspapers and on television under
                        the first generation hiring paradigm. Applicants
                        would send their resumes in via mail, and they
                        would be hand sorted. After the applications
                        have been shortlisted, the hiring staff will contact
                        them for additional rounds of interviews. This
                        was, without a doubt, a time-consuming
                        procedure. However, as the industries grew, so
                        did the demand for workers. As a result,
                        businesses began outsourcing their employment
                        processes. Hiring consultancies were established.
                        These agencies asked applicants to post their
                        resumes in certain forms to their websites. After
                        that, the agencies would look over the structured
                        data and provide a shortlist of prospects for the
                        organization. This method had a significant flaw. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        We were able to convert several resume formats to text and extract crucial information from
                        there. We were also able to harvest terms from several social networking sites, such as Stack
                        Overflow and LinkedIn, and detect similarities between them, allowing us to define the resume's
                        genre (e.g., computer science, management, sales, human resource, and so on). Future work will
                        include grading resumes and analysing information about candidates from social media sites such
                        as Facebook and Twitter so that we can make more accurate and authentic decisions about whether
                        or not to give the candidate a job.</p>
